**If you are looking for a way to distribute Python packages**, please see the
`Python Packaging User Guide <https://packaging.python.org/>`__.

Flit was an interesting experiment in Python packaging, but it has run its
course, and I can no longer recommend using it for new packages.

If you have already packaged projects with flit, it will continue to work for
the foreseeable future, but you should consider migrating back to standard
``setup.py`` packaging.
